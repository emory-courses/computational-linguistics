# Final Project

## Presentation

* Every team is expected to give a 15 mins presentation that may include discussions.
* Your presentation should emphasize your own methods and findings rather than describing related work.

## Report

Write up to 8 pages (excluding references) using [this template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vcfkhrmcjdvp):

* Header
  * Title.
  * Profile information of team members.
* Abstract
  * Description of your task and approach.
  * Summary of your results and findings.
  * Merit of this work.
* Introduction
  * Importance of the task.
  * Challenges with previous work.
  * Hypotheses to address those challenges.
  * Approaches to prove the hypothesis.
  * Significance (novelty, intellectual merits, and broader impact) of this work.
  * List of contributions.
* Related Work
  * Brief descriptions of related work.
  * Similarities and differences between the related work and your approach.
  * Weaknesses of the related work and how you address them in your approach.
* Approach
  * This section must clearly describe your methodology.
  * Do not make the description any data or language specific. The methodology explained in this section must be applicable to any dataset tackling the same task or other similar tasks.
  * If your methodology introduces new mechanisms, a figure should be drawn to describe the method. Figures must be exported as PDF with no white margin around them.
  * Equations are preferred over a block of text when appropriate.
  * Avoid spending so much space to explain work done by others. Focus on the novelty of your methodology and make clear distinctions between your methodology and the previous work.
  * Justify that your methodology suits well to prove your hypothesis in the introduction.
* Experiments
  * Describe the statistics of your data, possibly split into training, development, and evaluation sets.
  * Describe your experimental setup (e.g., external tools used for experiments, hyperparameters used in your models).
  * Summarize results in tables and illustrate any findings.
  * Give an error analysis to explain potential weaknesses of your approach. 
* Conclusion
  * Summarize key methods and findings.
  * Broader impact: upon completion, how your project can change the world
  * Future work: how to improve the quality of your chatbot
* Appendix
  * Supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results and/or to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper (optional)
