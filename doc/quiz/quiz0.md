# Quiz 0: Getting Started

## Submission

* Create a file called [`.gitignore`](../../.gitignore) under the `cs329` directory and copy the followings:
  ```
  .idea/
  venv/
  **/.ipynb_checkpoints/
  ```
* From PyCharm, add the followings to git by right clicking on those files and selecting `[Git] - [Add]` if not already:
  * `quiz/quiz0.ipynb`
  * `quiz/quiz0.py`
  * `.gitignore`
* Once the files are added to git, they should turn into green. If not, restart PyCharm and add the files again.
* Commit and push your changes to Github:
  * Right click on `cs329`, choose `[Git] - [Commit Directory]`, enter a commit message (e.g., "Submit quiz 0."), and click the `[Commit and Push]` button.
  * Make sure you both `commit` and `push`, not just `commit`.
* Check if the above files are properly pushed to your Github respoistory.
* Submit the address of your `cs329` repository (e.g., https://github.com/your_id/cs329.git) to https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/83264/assignments/444616
