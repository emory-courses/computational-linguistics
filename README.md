Computational Linguistics
=====

<!-- This course focuses on the analysis of plain text, syntactic and semantic structures, ontologies and taxonomies, as well as their applications in computational linguistics.
For text analysis, regular expressions and language models are discussed.
For syntactic analysis, phrase and dependency structures are discussed.
For semantic analysis, predicate argument structures and abstract meaning representation are discussed.
Computational lexicons such as Treebank, PropBank, WordNet, and FrameNet as well as advanced topics such as clustering algorithms, distributional semantics, and computational grammars are also discussed.

As the information age has revolutionized the way human lives, we are experiencing information overload where the amount of data we encounter grows beyond the human capacity.
Although multimedia became a substantial part of big data, text is still the most primitive yet dominating medium.
This interdisciplinary course addresses how to extract information in need from text (Linguistics), make statistical analysis of the extracted information (Quantitative Theory and Methods ), and write computer programs to automate this process (Computer Science).
