Now , I think talking about any child , regardless of sex , being violent is ian important subject .
But when you focus the discussion on girls then you 're completely missing the point and putting the undeserved and unfair attention on girls NOT BOYS.
For example :
Let 's say you 're a parent and you have 6 kids ( 5 boys , 1 girl ) and every week , your 5 boys fight with each other and they get into fights at school .
Every week they get sent home for fighting , cursing , bad behavior , etc .
Then one day , your one daughter , who has no history of such behavior , gets sent home from school for fighting .
Suddenly its " OMG Peggy Sue got into a fight .
What 's wrong with my daughter ! ?
This is all the WNBA 's fault ! ! ! "
Boys fighting should not be "boys being boys . "
teaching young men and boys that this is normal , and not calling them out while lambasting girls is such a male-dominated view to take .
ZERO stars folks !
stay away !
