In short , I highly recommend this book to anyone who espouses reason over vitriolic spew .
If you love America , but are troubled by the current state of affairs , this book may provide you with some level of inspiration .
I purposefully chose the audio version of this book because I have heard Reich speak and his quirky delivery is affecting .
