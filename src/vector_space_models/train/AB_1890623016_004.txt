Who would have thought that a book written in the 1800s could be so appealing today ?
Doing a little internet research , I have found that G.A. Henty lived from 1832-1902 , and the books he wrote were historical fiction " for boys " .
He was called " The Prince of Story-Tellers " and " The Boy 's Own Historian" , which certainly may have been true , but I 'm an adult female who loved this tale !
The style of writing sounds a little formal and old-fashioned , but it actually helps create a feeling of antiquity , appropriate for its ancient setting during the Punic Wars .<p>The fictional and lovable hero , Marchus , a relative of the famous Hannibal , accompanies him on the Carthaginian campaign against Rome .
I learned so much about Hannibal through this book , yet the majority of the plot involves other adventures that Marchus gets into .
He has near escapes from bears , wolves , lions , treacherous tribesmen .
In two instances , he escapes with the help of an elephant , and a raft in the subterranean reservoir of Carthage .
This was fun stuff , and I am so impressed that this book I found , that is so old it does n't even have a publication date in it , could be so delightful .
Someone could make a great movie out of this !
