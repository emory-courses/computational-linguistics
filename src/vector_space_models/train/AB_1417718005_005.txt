I bought this book because of the author 's reputation and was not disappointed .
Several story lines appear to occur simultaneously and enjoyably .
I plan to use this book with small groups of students and ask each student to narrate a different story line .
This is a fairly complex picture book that I 'm sure all will enjoy .
